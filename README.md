### About Me:
My name is Stephen Johnson and I'm working towards becoming a junior developer.

Currently, Iâ€™m learning Go and Python and planning to study machine learning as well as HTML & CSS. I'm also working on a number of guitar effects pedals utilizing the [Electro-Smith Daisy platform](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy).
Iâ€™m learning Go and Python at the moment.
